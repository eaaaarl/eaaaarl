- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @eaaaarl!
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning about technology, particularly deep learning, machine learning, and artificial intelligence (AI).
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently expanding my skills in both front-end and back-end development. On the front end, I'm focusing on React.js, TypeScript, and other frontend libraries. For the back end, I'm learning Laravel (PHP) and Node.js with MongoDB.
